HUCKEL_ENERGY

  A short F95 code to calculate the energy eigenvalues for a hamiltonian
  for a simple molecule using Huckel theory. This code makes use of the LAPACK
  and LBLAS Fortran libraries.
  
  We assume that all the bond lengths are the same so that the energies
  can be given in units of the off-diagonal hamiltonian elements and the
  0-energy taken to be the average energy (the diagonal hamiltonian elements)
 
  COMPILING HUCKEL_ENERGY: huckel_energy has a makefile, and so GNU Make can be used
                           to compile the program using the GNU Fortran compiler. Failing that, 
                           first compile thedoublePrecision.f90 module, then the other modules 
                           in arbitrary order, and finally the huckel_energy.f90 program itself.
                           Finally create the executable by linking the object code with the 
                           LAPACK and LBLAS libraries.

                           This code has been tested and compiled on the CMTH Red Hat machines
                           with GNU Fortran 4.1.2 and on Debian Squeeze with GNU Fortran 4.4.4
 
  CALLING HUCKEL_ENERGY: /path/to/huckel:~$ ./huckel_energy $INFILE $OUTFILE $CALCMODE
                         
                          INFILE: the file to read the hamiltonian from. It MUST be formatted
                                  so that the 1st line contains only the size of the hamiltonian
                                  and subsequent lines contain a matrix of space-separated numbers
                                  representing the hamiltonian in the Huckel Basis, with beta set
                                  to 1 and alpha set to 0 (and all other elements 0)
 
                         OUTFILE: the name of the file to have the results written to. Output is
                                  formatted such that the first line contains a space separated
                                  list of the hamiltonian's eigenvalues and (optionally) subsequent lines
                                  contain an orthogonal matrix whose columns correspond to the eigenvectors
                                  of the hamiltonian. 
 
                        CALCMODE: A single character, either "N" or "V". "N" means that the output will
                                  only contain the eigenvalues, "V" means that output will also contain the 
                                  matrix of eigenvectors
